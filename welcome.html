<h1>Joan</h1>

<p>Joan is a freeware tool to clean up C source code generated by the
SmallEiffel compiler. It replaces the cryptic mangled names by more
meaningful ones, reformats the indention, and removes distracting
comments.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The idea behind joan is of course stupid and sick:

<p>As of 2001, SmallEiffel does not include native debugging and
profiling tools. In some cases, <tt>print</tt> is good enough. If not,
many people use C tools.</p>

<p>Looking at the C source generated by SmallEiffel is not much fun.
Naturally, the code is terse in order to compile faster and use less
disk space. Joan cleans up this C code, making it easier to interpret.
In particular,it:</p>

<ul>

<li>assigns more meaningful names to most routines and types that
have a direct relation to the Eiffel source

<li>reformats indention to outline the structure

<li>removes all comments as the existing ones are completely useless
(I don't know why the SmallEiffel generates them; C doesn't need them,
and a developer won't understand them.)

</ul>

<p>To get most out of it, it helps to know how to implement exception
handling, garbage collection, and multiple inheritance. But even with
only some basic C knowledge, you should be able to step through Eiffel
routines and read profiler output.</p>

<p>In 2017, when SmallEiffel has an own IDE and tools, joan will not
be of much use anymore, except for tracking down Eiffel compiler
bugs.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>

<li> Get the <a href="http://smalleiffel.loria.fr/">SmallEiffel</a> compiler.

<li>Get GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/indent/">indent</a>,
which reformats C source code. You can get the source and compile it, but there
are already binary archives for a lot of (even non-Unixoid) systems somewhere on
the web. Just make sure it is in the search path. Don't read the manual, joan
knows about the proper options.

<li>Get <a href="http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/vahunz/">vahunz</a>, which
replaces names in C source code. Unless you're running AmigaOS, just
download <a
href="http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/vahunz/vahunz.zip">vahunz.zip</a>, <a
href="http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/vahunz/manual/source.html">compile</a>
it as described, and copy vahunz to some place in your search path.
Don't read the manual, joan knows about the proper options, and will
create all dictionaries and support files automatically.

<li>Get <a href="http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/joan/joan.zip">joan.zip</a>, which
contains the source code for the actual tool.

<li>Compile joan using SmallEiffel:

<blockquote><tt>compile -boost -no_split joan</tt></blockquote>

<li>Copy joan to some place in your search path.

</ol>

That's it.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Joan operates on the C source code and <tt>*.id</tt> file
SmallEiffel generates. All of these must exist. It then simply
replaces the "ugly" *.c by a one that will be easier to read.</p>

<p>The general pattern of operation is:</p>

<ol>

<li>Compile your Eiffel source using for example

<blockquote><tt>compile -no_split my_class</tt></blockquote>

This generates <tt>my_class</tt>.c, <tt>my_class.h</tt>, and
<tt>my_class.id</tt> It is important to have the option "-no_split" and
<em>not</em> to have "-clean".

<li>Use joan like

<blockquote><tt>joan my_class</tt></blockquote>

<li>Manually recompile the C source code joan created, for example

<blockquote><tt>gcc my_class.c -o my_class</tt></blockquote>

You can specify C compiler options for debugging, profiler, and coverage information at will.

<li>Run <tt>my_class</tt>, using all your C debugging and profiling tools.

</ol>

<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<p>If you just compiled joan as described in the installation section,
there still should be three files in your current directory:
<tt>joan.c</tt>, <tt>joan.h</tt>, and <tt>joan.id</tt>.</p>

<p>Take a look at joan.c - it is ugly</p>

<p>Now type</p>

<blockquote><tt>joan joan</tt></blockquote>

<p>and watch.</p>

<p>If everything works out, you will have a new <tt>joan.c</tt>. Take
a look at it, it should be nicer (as far as C can be nice).</p>


<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>Joan is released under the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>. (It has to be
like that because it uses code from SmallEiffel's "lib_se".)</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>If you have some questions about the meaning of a C excerpt, ask
them in the <a href="http://SmallEiffel.loria.fr/support/mailing-list.html">SmallEiffel
mailing list</a>. Search the archive because many of them have already been answered.
In particular, questions about profiling with C tools.</p>

<p>You can reach the author via e-mail: Thomas Aglassinger
&lt;agi@giga.or.at&gt;.</p>

<h2>Known Bugs and Limitations</h2>

<ul>

<li>Indent displays loads of warnings like

    <blockquote><tt>Warning:old style assignment ambiguity in "=*".  Assuming "= *"</tt></blockquote>

    You can ignore them. It seems there is no command line option to turn them off.
    (Tell me if you know better).

<li>All temporary files are still left around.

<li>The manual needs some additions, especially the copyright stuff.

<li>Only works if "-no_split" is used. Technically, it's not
difficult to support SE's incremental C sources. If you want to see
this, send me a note.

<li>Some command line options could be nice. Internally, they are
there (see JOAN_OPTIONS_SINGLETON), but there's no parser. If you want
one, send me a note.

</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Version 1.0, 17-Apr-2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>First, (somewhat) public release to get some feedback

</ul>

<h2>About Joan</h2>

<p>This tool is named after the actress Joan Collins. The relation is
that Eiffel looks nice, but after the compile time ("natural aging")
turns into ugly C. After applying joan, it looks better, but still
ugly. It's similar with women like Joan Collins: first, they look nice
(in a repulsive, American way). Enter natural aging ("compile time"),
and they get ugly. So they put on a mini-skirt, use 2 kg of make up,
and... you get the idea.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I came up with the name, I had to validate this claim.
Here's a couple of links I found interesting:

<ul>

<li>The Internet Movie Data Base has an <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Collins,+Joan">entry</a>, giving all the
details about her "carrier". I wonder how many people remember a
single of those movies? For comparison, there are also some bikini
pics before she had to start using 2 kg of makeup (Eiffel vs. C).

<li>Mr Showbiz has a short <a
href="http://mrshowbiz.go.com/celebrities/people/joancollins/bio.html">bio</a>
which is quite to the point.

<li>A <a
href="http://www.onepunch.com/womwam/actresses/JOANCOLLINS.htm">wacko
site</a> describes the various female archetypes she represents (no
porn, just strange).

<li>As always if you want to wade through piles of dead links in
order to see loads of badly forged nude pics, ask the mighty <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=joan+collins+nude">google</a>.
Actually, some of them should be real because she did some
sexploitation stuff during the seventies.

<li>While not directly related, some guy wrote an <a
href="http://www.gonzo.org/fun/wayward.html">article</a> about why a
lot of people end up on his (non-joan-collins-nude) site looking for
"joan collins nude". Most interesting for me, people actually search
for "joan collins <em>fake</em> nude". You never stop learning.

</ul>

<p>To sum it up: joan is as much a useful tool as Joan a decent actress.</p>
